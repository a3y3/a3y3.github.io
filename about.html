				<h2>About</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Soham Dongargaonkar. I am a passionate software developer, and I love problem solving. I also love working out, and playing badminton, ping pong, and CS:GO (also I am a HUGE fan of the Half-Life games).</p>
<p>Wondering about the meaning of life and meditating about who/what I really am is a big and important part of me. A lot of people think it's really weird when I tell them that; although perhaps it's more of my inability to convey exactly what "meaning of life" means. I believe the single most important, the most fundamental and personal question you can ask yourself is who or rather what, you really are. The resultant existential crisis is a very beautiful feeling; an ability to make everything seem meaningless at will has an unintended side effect of completely ridding you of stress, anger, frustrations, etc. Feel free to talk to me on my <a target="_blank" href="mailto:sohamssd@gmail.com">email</a> - if what I said sounds interesting to you or you want to discuss more.</p>
<p>As for my professional journey, I have been into computers/software ever since I can remember. Understanding computers comes naturally to me, and I can spend hours and hours (and hours) solving a bug. I feel its my immense love for technology that enables me to do that so easily.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, I worked at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.avalonlabs.co/">Avalon Labs</a> as a Full Stack Developer. During my time at Avalon Labs I created <a target="_blank" href="http://uselinkhero.com/">LinkHero</a> using Ruby on Rails and JS/jQuery. Working here was truly an awesome time for me, as I was completely in charge of programming LinkHero - that meant solving pretty difficult challenges everyday, and getting those small wins of solving them. I worked with a lot of really smart and energetic people - it was an amazing internship!</p>
<p>Currently I am a student at Rochester Institute of Technology and working as a co-op for 2 semesters (January - August) at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.motorolasolutions.com/">Motorola Solutions</a>. It has honestly been an incredible and a humbling experience so far. I am working with people way smarter and more experienced than me so there are tons of things to learn. I am working for MSI's Drone Team - the project is quite challenging and a lot of fun as:
<ul>
	<li>It's different from a normal CRUD application - every change you make can potentially affect drone response times.</li>
	<li>MSI's products are Mission Critical, so failure of the system isn't an option.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Here's where you can find me on the internet. I usually am pretty reserved about what I post about on social media, so you might not find a lot of me there.
