				<h2>About</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Soham Dongargaonkar. I am a passionate software developer, and I love problem solving. I also love working out, and playing badminton, ping pong, and CS:GO.</p>
<p>Wondering about the meaning of life and meditating about who/what I really am is a big and important part of me. I believe doing that a lot can completely rid you of stress, anger, frustrations, etc. and focus on what truly matters: being alive. My theory is that doing this with enough intensity can make everything seem meaningless to a point where you can become completely invincible to any negative (or for that matter, even postive) emotion ever. Feel free to talk to me on my <a target="_blank" href="mailto:sohamssd@gmail.com">email</a> - if feel you're on the same track as I am.</p>
<p>As for my professional journey, I have been into computers/software ever since I can remember. Understanding computers comes naturally to me, and I can spend hours and hours (and hours) solving a bug. I feel its my immense love for technology that enables me to do that so easily.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, I worked at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.avalonlabs.co/">Avalon Labs</a> as a Full Stack Developer. During my time at Avalon Labs I created <a target="_blank" href="http://uselinkhero.com/">LinkHero</a> using Ruby on Rails and JS/jQuery. Working here was truly an awesome time for me, as I was completely in charge of programming LinkHero - that meant solving pretty difficult challenges everyday, and getting those small wins of solving them. I worked with a lot of really smart and energetic people - it was an amazing internship.</p>
<p>Currently I am a student at Rochester Institute of Technology and working as a co-op for 2 semesters (January - August) at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.motorolasolutions.com/">Motorola Solutions</a>. It has been a pretty incredible journey so far, honestly. I am working with people way smarter and more experienced than me so there are tons of things to learn. I really feel software development is the best job in the world - you get paid a ton of money to solve a ton of puzzles. I don't have to wake up in the morning and tell myself to work hard - it automatically happens, because I like it so much!</p>
<p>Here's where you can find me on the internet. I usually am pretty reserved about what I post about on social media, so you might not find a lot of me there.
