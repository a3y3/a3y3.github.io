	<a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/">https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/</a> - I recently read this blog post and it really stirred something inside me. I've been playing with computers since the early 2000s and so I feel like I've seen them evolve over a period of 20 years. Now, if you had told the 12-year-old-hyper-excited-about-computers-me about the state of computers in 2020, I really wouldn't have believed it. Or if I had, I would have been very disappointed. 
</p>

	I disagree with the author's repeated claim of "everything's the same and we are just upgrading hardware to keep the same software running". It's kind of true, but not entirely. I feel like we've made progress, but definitely not keeping in line with the growth in the corresponding resource consumption. A blank, freshly installed Angular app - that does absolutely nothing is around 300 MB when built. <i>Clearly,</i> there's something wrong with that. Android apps just seem to get bloated over time. The Galaxy S20 Ultra has a 16GB of RAM - <i>my laptop</i> doesn't have that! Is that really a thing to be proud of? Why should a handheld device even require such ludcrious amounts of RAM? And before you say it does very complicated operations or runs sophisticated algorithms, there's no way <i>ever</i> that any combination of applications should need to keep <i>16 gigabytes</i> of data in memory.

	I just feel like we've placed so much importance to the "programmer time vs computer time" analogy that we've forgotten what computers earlier were even like. I feel like asking everyone to just stop for a while, think about what we are doing and how this is going to scale/work in the near future. Do we really want to reach that point where blank Angular apps are 1GB large? 
</p>

	With the way the industry is progressing, I doubt we can even turn back now. If so many websites run on NodeJS, is there really a way in the near future that we can just spontaneously shift to a lighter and faster web framework? I wonder what the solution is.

	I'm not saying everything is going to crash and burn to the ground - it's just that in my opinion this isn't the ideal state that we could have been in. And it just bugs me a lot that something I love so much isn't perfect, or isn't going to be for a long, long time.
