Hi, my name is Soham Dongargaonkar. I am a Software Engineer and have recently become interested in Distributed Systems and low level systems programming. I spend most of my time developing software, playing games, and wondering about who/what I am.

As for my professional journey, I have been into computers/software ever since I can remember. Understanding computers comes naturally to me, and I can spend hours and hours writing code or solving bugs. Check out my GitHub [here!](https://github.com/a3y3)

Here's where you can find me on the internet. I usually am pretty reserved about what I post about on social media, so you might not find a lot of me there.
